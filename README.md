## 4. What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

- To define a variable;

  let count = finances.length;

  let monthlyDifferenceTotal = 0;

  let greatestIncrease = 0;

  let greatestDecrease = 0;

  let greatestIncreaseMonth = "Date";

- To create a for loop;

  for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {
  const element = array[index];
  }

- To print in console;

  console.log("Average Change: " + averageTotal);

  console.log("Greatest Increase: " + greatestIncreaseMonth + ": $" + greatestIncrease);
